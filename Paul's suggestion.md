Hi everyone. As you are working on your literature review, I wanted to give you the following suggestions:

**Related Research Types: There are at least three types of research types that I identify.**  
1. **Directly-Related:** These are research works that try to solve the same specific research problem as you, but which you try to do better or differently. For example, you are creating a VR interface for blind users, and there is a related work that is also a VR interface for blind users.  
2. **Peripherally-Related:** These are research works that solve the general research area as you, but solve a different specific problem. For example, you are creating a VR interface for blind users, and there is a related work that is a multi-touch interface for blind users.  
3. **Support-Related:** These are research works that are generally from other research areas or research sub-areas that don't solve your problem, but support your research work. For example, you are creating a VR interface for blind users, and there is an HCI related work that describes VR interaction problems for blind users, and another medical related work that describes how blind users physically move.  

**Appropriate Sections for Literature Review: There are at least three sections in your paper to put your related work.**  
1. **Introduction:** Put cited work that support your motivation (e.g., Support-Related) here.  
2. **Related Work:** Put cited work that relate to your research either directly or peripherally here.  
3. **Design/Implementation/Methodology:** For cited work where you use their techniques, design, or system for your own technique, design, or system, cite your work here.
